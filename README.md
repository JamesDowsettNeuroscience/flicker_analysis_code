# flicker_analysis_code
Data analysis code for all experiments using SSVEPs/Flicker 

Here is a list of current data sets, with some detail about the EEG recording:

Current full data sets:

Walking vs. Standing gamma flicker part 1
30-60Hz, LiveAmp 8chan  – normal triggers, 1000 Hz sample rate

Walking vs. Standing  part 2: 35 Hz and 40 Hz
35 and 40 Hz, MOVE amp 64chan – triggers with photo-diode,  1000 Hz sample rate

Mentalab dry electrode (part 1)
9 Hz, Mentalab 8chan - triggers with photo-diode,  1000 Hz sample rate

Gamma flicker basic stimuli (Colour, Luminance, Duty Cycle)
30-60Hz, BrainAmp 64chan –  normal triggers, 5000 Hz sample rate
